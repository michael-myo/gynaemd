    <p>Since <a href="http://www.gynaemd.com.sg/gynaecology_infertility.html" title="In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF)">In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF)</a> and Intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) need more monitoring compared to other infertility treatments, couples need to undergo a detailed consultation with our infertility gynaecologist before commencing the treatment at our IVF centre so that they have a more thorough understanding about what to expect.  This helps to reduce patient anxiety when they realise that modern IVF treatments are now relatively stress free.</p>
           
    <p>IVF regimes employed in our IVF clinic involve controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with hormonal injections which results in the development of more eggs (follicles) and hence better chance of pregnancy. Once the eggs are mature and reach the desired size, they are collected using a special needle attached to a vaginal ultrasound probe. Women are sedated during this egg retrieval procedure (minor IVF surgery). A single sperm is then injected into each collected egg via a microneedle to facilitate fertilization in a process called intra-Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI). The embryos are transferred (embryo transfer) into the womb a few days after fertilization using a fine catheter which is usually painless.  Any extra embryos that are not transferred may be frozen and stored for later use (embryo freezing).</p>

     <h1>What To Expect <span>On Your Initial Visit for an IVF Consultation</span></h1>
     <p>On the day of your initial consultation with our fertility gynaecologist, it would be helpful if you could provide us with an accurate medical history. Please bring records of your past fertility treatment and gynaecological surgery if any so that we can then have a better understanding of your problem.</p>
     
     <h3>Meeting with the IVF Gynaecologist</h3>
     <p>Infertility is a very sensitive and delicate problem and everyone’s needs is unique. That is why our fertility gynaecologist will have to perform some basic evaluation based on your medical history and physical examination as well as a combination of ultrasound scan, hysterosalpingography (HSG), semen analysis, ovulation assessment, etc.</p>
     <p>Based on the results of these tests, treatments like ovulation induction, surgery to remove growths (polyps or fibroids) or adhesions, superovulation intra-uterine insemination (SO-IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) can be commenced.</p>
