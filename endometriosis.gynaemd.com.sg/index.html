    <p>Our gynaecologist performs open and laparoscopic surgical procedures including laparoscopic removal of ovarian cysts, ovaries, fallopian tubes, fibroids, adhesions and the womb. </p>

<p>Laparoscopic (or key-hole) surgery is carried out under general anaesthesia. It involves a small cut in the umbilicus so that a tiny telescope can be inserted to examine your reproductive organs and to look for any abnormalities, problems or damage.</p>

<p>The benefits of laparoscopic surgery are no or shorter hospital stays, minimal post-op discomfort, reduced analgesia, faster return to normal activities and aesthetically pleasing scars.

     <h1>What To Expect <span>On Your Initial Visit to the Gynaecologist</span></h1>
     <p>You may wish to prepare a list of questions to ask before seeing us so that you will not miss out anything important. Ask for the appointment on a day when you know you will not be having your period. Be sure to bring a list of all medications and supplements that you are taking.</p>
     
     <h3>Meeting with the Gynaecologist</h3>
     <p>Your visit with the gynaecologist should be a pleasant one and will begin much as a typical visit to your family physician. You will be asked about your medical and surgical history, medications, health problems, etc. We are committed to providing a pleasant and relaxed environment so that you will be forthcoming in asking questions and discussing your preferences with us. Quality care begins with good communication and a good gynaecologist will take time to listen and to explain the various treatment options. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.gynaemd.com.sg/gynaecology_general.html" title="Endometriosis" class="link">Endometriosis</a> is a condition where the tissues that line the inside of the womb (endometrium) are found outside the womb, in muscle layer of the womb (adenomyosis), ovary, bladder and bowel. Women may present with heavy and sometimes irregular periods, painful periods, pain during intercourse and lower abdominal pain in between periods. Endometriosis may also affect a woman’s ability to conceive. Treatment depends on symptoms and may involve observation, medication or surgery depending on its severity.</p>

<p>Ovarian cysts are fluid filled sacs. Most ovarian cysts are benign (non-cancerous) but some are cancerous, or may become cancerous over time. Ovarian cysts can vary in size - from less than the size of a pea to the size of a large orange (sometimes even larger). Some ovarian cysts may cause problems such as abdominal swelling, pelvic pain (constant or intermittent), pain during intercourse, irregular or heavy periods. Treatment depends on symptoms, size and nature of the cyst and may involve observation, medication or surgery.</p>
