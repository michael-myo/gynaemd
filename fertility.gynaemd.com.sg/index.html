Ask for the appointment on a day when you know you will not be having your period. Be sure to bring a list of all medications and supplements that you are taking. Your visit should be a pleasant one and will begin much as a typical visit to your family physician. You will be asked about your medical and surgical history, medications, health problems, etc.  We are committed to providing a pleasant and relaxed environment so that you will be forthcoming in asking questions and discussing your preferences with us. Quality care begins with good communication and a good gynaecologist will take time to listen and to explain the various treatment options.  </p>

                      <div id="panel1b" class="content">
                      <p>The majority of healthy couples do not suffer from female fertility or male fertility issues. Couples are said to suffer from infertility (female infertility and / or male infertility) if they have not been able to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse without the use of contraception. Infertility affects 15% of couples. </p>

                      <div id="panel1c" class="content">
                      <p>In superovulation intra-uterine insemination (SO-IUI), several ovarian follicles (eggs) are stimulated and brought to maturation and ovulation. On the day of the insemination (IUI), the husband produces a fresh semen sample. The semen then undergoes special preparation and the healthy portion of it is then inseminated (IUI) into the womb using a very fine tube by our fertility specialist. Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tubes.
                      </p>
                      <p>In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is a technique in which the egg cells and sperms are fertilized in the laboratory of our IVF centre outside the woman’s womb. IVF regimes employed in our IVF clinic involve controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with hormonal injections which results in the development of more eggs (follicles) and hence better chance of pregnancy. Once the eggs are mature and reach the desired size, they are collected using a special needle attached to a vaginal ultrasound probe. Women are sedated during this egg retrieval procedure (minor IVF surgery).  The sperms are combined with the collected eggs and allowed to fertilize. Once fertilization has occurred by IVF and ICSI, the embryos are transferred (embryo transfer) into the womb a few days after fertilization using a fine catheter which is usually painless.  Any extra embryos that are not transferred may be frozen and stored for later use (embryo freezing).
