     <h1>What To Expect <span>On Your Initial Visit to the Gynaecologist</span></h1>
     <p>You may wish to prepare a list of questions to ask before seeing us so that you will not miss out anything important. Ask for the appointment on a day when you know you will not be having your period. Be sure to bring a list of all medications and supplements that you are taking. </p>
     
     <h3>Meeting with the Gynaecologist</h3>
     <p>Your visit with the gynaecologist should be a pleasant one and will begin much as a typical visit to your family physician. You will be asked about your medical and surgical history, medications, health problems, etc. We are committed to providing a pleasant and relaxed environment so that you will be forthcoming in asking questions and discussing your preferences with us. Quality care begins with good communication and a good gynaecologist will take time to listen and to explain the various treatment options. </p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.gynaemd.com.sg/gynaecology_cancer.html" title="Cervical cancer screening" class="link">Cervical cancer screening</a> involves routine Pap smears aimed at women with no symptoms. It is a simple painless test in which cells from the cervix are examined for any abnormalities that could lead to cancer. Fortunately, some early changes in the cervix can be seen long before cancer develops (pre-cancer stage). Once these changes are treated, cancer can be prevented. </p>

                      <div id="panel1c" class="content">
                      
<p>It is recommended that all women who have ever had sexual intercourse should have regular Pap smears so that problems can be detected early and thus treated before they become serious.

                      <div id="panel1d" class="content">
                      <p>Colposcopy is a way of looking at the cervix through a special magnifying device. This allows the doctor to find problems that cannot be seen by the eye alone. It is a relatively painless procedure in which the cervix is examined under magnification after acetic acid is applied to the cervix.

<br><br>
Biopsies of abnormal areas are taken for further evaluation and treatment can be performed based on these results.

                      <p>There are over 100 identified types of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), most of which are harmless and asymptomatic. HPV is spread through sexual contact targeting the genitals. There are 15 cancer-causing types which can lead to cervical cancer. The HPV Vaccination has been proven to provide protection against HPV infection and lifetime immunity against cervical cancer. It is however not a substitute for routine Pap smears for cervical cancer screening.</p>
