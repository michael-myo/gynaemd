					<p>In May 2012, <a class="h2text" href="<?php echo homepage_url() ?>">Gynaecologist</a>, Dr Christopher Ng marked a milestone in the growth of the GynaeMD brand by opening up GynaeMD Women’s Clinic at Clementi which is helmed by his wife, Dr Regina, who is also an obstetrician & gynaecologist. With the group’s continued growth, in May 2015 GynaeMD group of clinics expanded by having Dr Candice Wang join our GynaeMD Clementi Clinic.</p>
					<p>Dr Ng complements his practice in obstetrics and gynaecology with aesthetics. He has been mentored and attended courses conducted by aesthetic medicine physicians including Dr Melvin Elson, Dr Michel Delune, Dr Pierre Fournier, Dr Patrick Micheels, Dr Gustavo Leibaschoff‎, Dr Byung-Soon Park, Dr Sooil Chun, Dr Kyung Tae Hong and Prof Goh Chee Leok from USA, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Argentina, South Korea and Singapore to further refine his knowledge and  techniques. His passion for aesthetics has brought him to conferences and courses in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea and France. He has completed aesthetic courses run by the American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine and by the Anteis InjectNow Academy™ at the Mérieux Foundation in Annecy, France. He has also obtained the Certificates of Competence in all aesthetic procedures recognised by the Singapore Medical Council Aesthetic Practice Oversight Committee.</p>
					<p>To enhance his obstetric, gynaecology and aesthetic practice, Dr Ng is a firm believer in good nutrition, health supplements in addition to conventional medication to optimize the body’s natural capacity to heal from within. He has attended courses by Prof Ian Brighthope in Australia and obtained his certificate of achievement in nutrition and herbal protocols in 2002.</p>
					<p>In the spirit of community service, Dr Ng volunteers his time regularly to serve as a grass root leader to Queenstown Community Centre in Tanjong Pagar GRC. Aside from medicine, he is an avid golfer, a motoring enthusiast and is happily married with two adorable little girls. As a result, he has put his amateur golfing career on hold and instead of spending time at the race track, most of his motoring enthusiasm is now spent on chauffeuring his two young daughters around.</p>
